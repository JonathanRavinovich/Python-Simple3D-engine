# Python-Simple3D-engine
A simple 3d engine that i made, its using raytracing to determine the z axis its basically the same technic that id software used in the game Wolfenstein 3D 
The engine is a little weird when the player is new a block like in hallway
I used pygame for the graphics

Controls:
m - for toggle the map, in the map you can place blocks with left click anywhere in the map
w - move forward
s - move backward
left and right arrows - changing the rotation of the player
o and i - changing the ray step which affects the accuracy of the z axis and the quality of the block
k and l - changing the viewing angle of the player aka the FOV
